= Why Disable content selection is not working ? =

Actually your theme doesn't have `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` in footer, so please edit the footer of your theme and insert that code. 
To edit the theme  go to Design >> Theme Editor >> Select "Footer.php" from right hand list >>  and paste `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` just before the '< /body >' tag.
If possible add this code near to Wordpress link. 
The "disable Content selection" will start working.
